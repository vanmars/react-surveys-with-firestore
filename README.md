# :clipboard: _Survey Generator with React and Firestore_

_7 December 2020_

#### _Website for making and taking surveys_

#### By _**Vanessa Stewart**_

## :mag_right: Description

_This is a project for Epicodus to practuce adding Firestore to a React app with full CRUD functionality. The original instructions include:_

Create an application that allows a user to complete a quiz or survey. Users should be able to create new quizzes or surveys while other users should have the ability to fill out those surveys. To make this prompt a bit easier, you can have a set number of questions for each quiz or survey - that way, the surveys don't need to be dynamically rendered. (For instance, the form could have fields for response1, response2, and so on.)

## :books: User Stories
| #    | Story |
| ---- | ----- |
| 1 | A user should be able to create, update and delete a survey. All surveys should be stored in the database. |
| 2 | A user should be able to fill out and submit surveys. Survey results should be submitted to the database. (A survey result can be associated to a survey by mimicking a one-to-many relationship.) |
| 3 | A user should be able to sign up, sign in, and sign out. |
| 4 | A user should have their own dashboard which lists the surveys they've created. |
| Bonus | A user should be able to see the combined data on a survey in their dashboard. For instance, if a survey provides a 1-5 rating, return an average rating for all surveys. |
| Challenging | Try using a library like D3 to visualize data from surveys. This is only recommended if you have time to spare, interest in data visualization, and are doing a week-long project. |
